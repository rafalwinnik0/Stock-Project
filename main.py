## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#daily
# When stock price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

#TODO 1. - Get yesterday's closing stock price. Hint: You can perform list comprehensions on Python dictionaries. e.g. [new_value for (key, value) in dictionary.items()]

# day = datetime.now().day
# yesterday = str(day - 1)
# month = str(datetime.now().month)
# year = str(datetime.now().year)
# hour = "20:00:00"
# yesterday_date = year + "-" + month + "-" + yesterday
# print(yesterday_date)

params = {
    "function": "TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY",
    "symbol": STOCK_NAME,
    "interval": "60min",
    "apikey": NEWS_API_KEY
}

response = requests.get(STOCK_ENDPOINT, params)
response.raise_for_status()
data = response.json()
yesterday_closing_price = data["Time Series (60min)"]["2023-05-09 20:00:00"]["4. close"]
print(yesterday_closing_price)

#TODO 2. - Get the day before yesterday's closing stock price

day_before_yesterday_closing_price = int(data["Time Series (60min)"]["2023-05-08 20:00:00"]["4. close"])
print(day_before_yesterday_closing_price)
print(type(day_before_yesterday_closing_price))

#TODO 3. - Find the positive difference between 1 and 2. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20. Hint: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_abs.asp

# price_different = abs(day_before_yesterday_closing_price - yesterday_closing_price)

#TODO 4. - Work out the percentage difference in price between closing price yesterday and closing price the day before yesterday.

# percentage_difference = price_different / day_before_yesterday_closing_price
# print(percentage_difference)
# print(type(percentage_difference))

#TODO 5. - If TODO4 percentage is greater than 5 then print("Get News").



    ## STEP 2: https://newsapi.org/
    # Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME.

#TODO 6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.

#TODO 7. - Use Python slice operator to create a list that contains the first 3 articles. Hint: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation


    ## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
    #to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number.

#TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.

#TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio.



#Optional TODO: Format the message like this:
"""
